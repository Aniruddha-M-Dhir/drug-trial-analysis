# Drug Testing â€“ Venn Analysis & Visualization

This Python project analyzes drug trial results across **three drugs (A, B, C)** using the **inclusionâ€“exclusion principle** and visualizes the overlaps with a **3-set Venn diagram**.  
It also identifies the **best** or **worst** performing drug (or overlap) based on user input.

## ðŸ”¹ Features
- Accepts user inputs for drug trial counts:
  - `|A|, |B|, |C|, |Aâˆ©B|, |Aâˆ©C|, |Bâˆ©C|, |A âˆª B âˆª C|`
- Calculates the **triple overlap** `|A âˆ© B âˆ© C|`
- Performs a **sanity check** to warn about inconsistent inputs
- Reports **best** or **worst** performers (max/min positives)
- Plots a **3-set Venn diagram** with `matplotlib-venn`

## ðŸ§® Formula Used
The triple overlap is computed using **inclusionâ€“exclusion**:
|A âˆ© B âˆ© C| = |A âˆª B âˆª C| âˆ’ (|A| + |B| + |C|) + (|Aâˆ©B| + |Aâˆ©C| + |Bâˆ©C|)
